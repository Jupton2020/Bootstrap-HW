# Bootstrap-HW

I've created a portfolio page that is responsive, and uses Bootstrap and principles from HTML and CSS. This page is an upgrade from the first assignment when I used only HTML and CSS. 

# Content
My portfolio contains:
* Index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html as well as style.css.
* A responsive navbar with drop-down menu on small screens.
* Responsive images and layout of all pages. 
* Functional links.
* Bootstraps grid system with containers, rows and columns.
* A sticky-footer.
* Sub-rows and columns on my "About Me" page.
